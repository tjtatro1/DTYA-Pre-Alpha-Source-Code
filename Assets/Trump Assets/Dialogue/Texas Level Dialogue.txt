Trump: Ah, Lyin' Ted! It's good to see you again. Real good!
Trump: How's your JFK-killing father doing?
Ted Cruz: Donald, how many times do I have to say this? My father had nothing to do with JFK's death.
Trump: There you go again! Lying as always! You're a liar, Ted. A big one. Perhaps, the biggest I've ever seen.
Trump: Don't worry. Maybe Canada will take you back after you lose your presidential bid here.
Cruz: Quit it with the big talk, Donald. You're campaign ends here at my hands.
Cruz: It is God's will that I beat you.

Trump: Huh, I guess that woman was right.
Trump: Ted IS a pussy.

Trump: What the hell's going on?
Cruz: I've returned to my original form. The one known to you as the Zodiac Killer.
Trump: The Zodiac Killer!?
Trump: I saw those memes on my Twitter saying you were the Zodiac Killer.
Trump: I thought to myself, "Great meme! Great meme!"
Trump: But I never thought it was actually true! I was really right about you being Lyin' --
Cruz: Be quiet, Donald. You are about to become nothing more than another one of my victims.

Cruz: I swore I'd never go back to this form, but they...they forced me to...
Cruz: They would have killed us all...
Trump: Whatever, Losin' Ted. That's my new name for you. Losin' Ted! All you do is lose!

???: This presidential race is much more profound than you could ever comprehend, Donald.
Trump: Who is that?
???: You destroyed their plans, Donald. You destroyed all of our plans.
???: You were never accounted for, and despite everything we've tried, you're still going.
Trump: Little Marco...?
Trump: But...I thought Christie killed you in that Republican debate.

RubioBot: Well, you would be wrong then, Donald.
